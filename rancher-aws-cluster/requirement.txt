Inside the cloudcents-terraform
need to have one module to build the 
rancher UI
global cluster
infrastructure

all these 3 items will depend on the region


Things to modify after 1st demo

Create a key pair and store it into the AWS secret
Instances created need to have the SSM agent so we can connect to them via web browser AND also SSH
Subnets CIDR; for now only 2 cidr block 10.0.1.0/24 for public and 10.0.2.0/24 for private
Needs to have tfvars files based on region. For example the us-east-1-terrafrom.tfvars will have region = us-east-1
and the rest of the content to run the tfe apply it will be
terraform apply -v us-east-1-terraform.tfvars
I will provide you with the ami-id for the instances

Your questions??
Rancher: The Rancher UI will be accessible via the dns rancher.cloudcents.bylight.com
